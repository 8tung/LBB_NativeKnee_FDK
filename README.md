# LBB_NativeKnee_FDK
This repository contains 42 native knee joint models developed by the LBB Lab, combining LBB bone geometries with the OpenKnee(s) dataset. Based on the original TKA_Squat model, these FDK-compatible AMS models include cartilage and meniscus structures to study the influence of tibial slope on tibiofemoral contact forces.
